System for Wireless or mobile tethered shooting and transferring the pictures to a remote PC, tablet or server using a Raspberry Pi.

#About
Inspired by the following blogpost [Camera Pi â€“ DSLR Camera with Embedded Computer](http://www.davidhunt.ie/raspberry-pi-in-a-dslr-camera/) i decedid to recreate (to some extent) this project using the new Raspberry Pi 3. **PIphoto** allows you to attach your Raspberry PI 3 to your camera (DSLR/Point-and-Shoot) and take pictures in **Raw or jpeg** format, resize those iamges on the fly and send them to a remote system (PC/tablet/server). 

<blockquote>Simply put, PIphoto makes your camera as connected as your smartphone.</blockquote>

Doesn't this functionality already exists? Yes kinda, there are mobile applications which seems to have this kind of functionality. There are also devices created by camera manufacturers which seems to implement this kind of functionality, for instance the
[wireless file transmitter](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/wireless-file-transmitter/wireless-file-transmitter-wft-e6a) created by Canon. But one problem with the wireless file transmitter is it's hefty price. Expect to pay between 450 and 600 USD. Another problem is that the WiFi transmitter only works over WiFI. In a time where everybody seems to be connected via 3G/4G/LTE its seems more then logical that photographers should be able to use that technology for transferrring there images. The **Raspberry Pi with its buildin WiFi** or connected with a **3G/4G/LTE USB dongle** feels like a perfect candidate to create a true mobile photography workflow.
