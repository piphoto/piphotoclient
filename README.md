System for transferring DSLR pictures to a remote host using a Raspberry Pi.

#About
Inspired by the following blogpost [Camera Pi â€“ DSLR Camera with Embedded Computer](http://www.davidhunt.ie/raspberry-pi-in-a-dslr-camera/) I decided to recreate (to some extent) this project using the new Raspberry Pi 3. **PIphoto** allows you to attach your Raspberry PI 3 to your camera (DSLR/Point-and-Shoot) and take pictures in **raw or JPEG** format, resize those images on the fly and send them to a remote system (PC/tablet/server). 

<blockquote>Simply put, PIphoto makes your camera as connected as your smartphone.</blockquote>

Doesn't this functionality already exist? Yes kinda, there are mobile applications which seem to have this kind of functionality. There are also devices created by camera manufacturers which seem to implement this kind of functionality, for instance the
[wireless file transmitter](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/wireless-file-transmitter/wireless-file-transmitter-wft-e6a) created by Canon. But one problem with the wireless file transmitter is its hefty price. Expect to pay between 450 and 600 USD. Another problem is that the WiFi transmitter only works over WiFI. In a time where everybody seems to be connected via 3G/4G/LTE its seems more than logical that photographers should be able to use that technology for transferrring their images. The **Raspberry Pi with its built-in WiFi** or connected with a **3G/4G/LTE USB dongle** feels like a perfect candidate to create a truly mobile photography workflow.
